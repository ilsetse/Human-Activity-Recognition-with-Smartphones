Dataset is downloaded [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones)  

Using a hybrid SVM/HMM method, a ~96% classification accuracy was achieved
on the test set, with 100% accuracy on the activity LAYING.

I'm currently researching this technique for my master's
thesis -- mistakes may be present and feel free to point
them out at [ilsetse@gmail.com](mailto:ilsetse@gmail.com).
